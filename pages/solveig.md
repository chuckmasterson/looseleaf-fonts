**Solveig** is a stressed sans that draws inspiration from calligraphy and classic inscriptions. Its ascenders and descenders are long and expressive; in place of finials, its terminals taper to points. It is well suited for display, but remains very readable at smaller sizes in longer passages.

Solveig is named after Edvard Grieg’s “Solveig’s Song,” a quiet piece of concentrated, chilled emotion that accompanied me through the entire design process.
