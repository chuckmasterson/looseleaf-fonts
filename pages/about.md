I’ve drawn fancy lettering practically since I learned to write. After enough doodling during school
when I was meant to be paying attention, I got good at it and decided maybe I should do something
about it. 

That something turned out to be designing fonts, a pursuit I kept at for several years. Over the
course of that time I finished three fonts, which I sold online through
[MyFonts](http://www.myfonts.com) and the erstwhile Veer.

My fonts had a brief heyday of very modest popularity, and then joined the background noise of the
thousands upon thousands of good fonts that are out there. Meanwhile, I’ve gotten interested in free
software, and in 2017 I decided that I’d make my fonts free and open-source, as a way of giving back
to the open-source community.

These three fonts---Newt Serif, Solveig, and Walleye---are probably the only ones that will come
from Looseleaf Fonts. I’ve moved on to different interests in life, and hope to spend fewer hours
fiddling with computers. I still enjoy lettering, but mostly in ways like painting signs and
designing tattoos. When I do those things, I get to see someone enjoying my work, and I feel I’ve
accomplished something tangible. (Making fonts always felt a bit like sending my finished efforts
out into the digital æther.)
